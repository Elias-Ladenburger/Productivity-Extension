              <p>
                As service provider, I am liable for all contents of this
                website according to Paragraph 7, Sect. 1 German Telemedia Act
                (TMG). However, according to Paragraphs 8 to 10 German Telemedia
                Act (TMG), service providers are not obligated to permanently
                monitor submitted or stored information or to search for
                evidences that indicate illegal activities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Legal obligations to removing information or to blocking the use
                of information remain unchallenged. In this case, liability is
                only possible at the time of knowledge about a specific
                violation of law. Illegal contents will be removed immediately
                at the time that I receive knowledge of them.
              </p>
              <h3 class="text-xl my-5">Liability for Links</h3>
              <p>
                This product includes links to external third party websites. I
                have no influence on the contents of those websites, therefore I
                cannot guarantee for those contents. Providers or administrators

                contents.
              </p>
              <p>
                The linked websites have been checked for possible violations of
                law at the time of the establishment of the link. Illegal
                contents were not detected at the time of the linking. A
                permanent monitoring of the contents of linked websites cannot
                be imposed without reasonable indications that there has been a
                violation of law. Illegal links will be removed immediately at
                the time that I receive knowledge of them.
